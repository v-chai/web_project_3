                    Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their
                    right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point.
                    Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.

                <p class="place__paragraph">
                    The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified
                    balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and
                    those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on
                    the far outskirts of the right one.

                    Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

                    A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret
                    ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in
                    Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd
                    George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                    Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and
                    countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping
                    opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a
                    yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                    However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in
                    the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
                    tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                    Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because
                    of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the
                    center of Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals

                    The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft)
                    above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the
                    largest plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.

                    The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes, overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya.
                    This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660
                    meters of altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which
                    provide water around the country.
